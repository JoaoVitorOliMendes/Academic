# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains implementations of fundamental and advanced algorithms and data structures in multiple programming languages. It is intended as a structured study resource for computer science students and practitioners who seek to deepen their understanding of computational logic, problem-solving strategies, and the inner workings of widely used programming techniques.

The content is organized by topic (e.g., sorting, searching, trees, graphs) and includes multiple language implementations to provide a comparative perspective across programming paradigms. The goal is to reinforce theoretical concepts through practical examples, support algorithmic thinking, and promote familiarity with common data structure patterns.

All code is written with readability and clarity in mind, aiming to serve both as a learning reference and a foundation for more advanced projects or academic exercises.
